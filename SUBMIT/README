Path names for cells:
1. INV
/CAD1_LIB/INV

2. NAND2
/CAD1_LIB/NAND2

3. MUX21
/CAD1_LIB/MUX21

Maximum risetime
0.851887 ns 

Maximum falltime
0.45748 ns 

Critical path analysis
SEL --> I5 --> I2 --> I4 --> OUT

Critical path rise delay
0.5 ns

Critical path fall delay
0.32534 ns

The critical path delay can be measured when SEL signal transitions from HIGH(1)
to LOW(0). 
This is identified as the critical path of the MUX21 because this is the path 
where the signal has to go through the largest number of logic gates to affect 
the output. The propagation delay at this time would be slowest as it has to 
suffer from the delay of all the logic gates it goes through.


Comment & Summary
The critical points of this layout design for me is to confirm the positions of
the nets at the early stage of NAND and INV layout design, which will
be connected during the component integration by vias to ensure their 
center point coordinates abide by the metal tracks position rules.

The MUX layout design employs the horizotal layout and the INV is placed at the 
second position from the left to reduce the area needed for connection using 
metal layers. This layout also only involves one path that crosses layer 3, minimizing
the cross-layer transmission.
